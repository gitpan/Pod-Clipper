NAME
    Pod::Clipper::Block - A block of POD or non-POD data

SYNOPSIS
      use Pod::Clipper::Block;
      my $block = Pod::Clipper::Block->new({ data => $data, is_pod => 1 });

DESCRIPTION
    This module has very limited use on its own. It's mainly used as a
    helper for "Pod::Clipper". Each "Pod::Clipper::Block" object stores a
    block of text along with a flag about whether the stored text is POD or
    non-POD data. Both of these parameters have to be provided when you
    construct the object. There's nothing preventing you from providing
    conflicting parameters, e.g. "data" can be non-POD yet you set "is_pod"
    to true or vice versa (not sure why you would want to do that, though).

METHODS
  new
    This is the "Pod::Clipper::Block" constructor. It expects a hash
    reference with two mandatory options: "data" and "is_pod".

  data
    Returns the block of data stored in the object. You can also use it to
    set new data.

      print $block->data;
      $block->data($new_data);

  is_pod
    Returns a boolean value describing the type of the data in your block. 1
    => POD, 0 => non-POD. "Pod::Clipper::Block" does not check your data for
    whether it's POD or non-POD. It simply returns whatever you've set the
    "is_pod" option to (via the constructor or this method).

      print "POD!" if $block->is_pod;
      $block->is_pod(0); # assign it a new value

BUGS
    There are no known bugs. If you find one, please report it to me at the
